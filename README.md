# DSW_Data-Porter_Customer-Churn-Prediction
Welcome to the official GitHub repository of the Data Challenge project, presented as part of the Data Science Week event organized by Data Science Indo and Telkom Indonesia. This project is proudly developed by Team Data Porter.

## Project Overview:
Our focus in this data challenge was on tackling the churn prediction problem in customer data using machine learning classification techniques. The goal was to employ advanced data science methodologies to identify potential churners and develop actionable insights for businesses.

## Key Features:

* Churn Prediction Model: We implemented a robust classification machine learning model that predicts customer churn based on historical data and relevant features.

* Web Application: As part of our commitment to practical applications, we built a user-friendly web application to showcase the model's predictions. This allows users to interactively input data and receive real-time churn predictions.
